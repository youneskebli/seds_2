    "During this exam, you are permitted to refer to your lecture notes, lab materials, or any online standard FastAPI and StreamLit Python libraries documentations. Additionally, you may use resources such as Stack Overflow or their alternatives for problem-solving, or addressing code compilation errors. However, the use of ChatGPT and its alternatives is strictly prohibited. Please be aware that your solutions will undergo an AI-based ChatGPT detection process to ensure compliance. It is imperative that you rely on the authorized resources for assistance during the exam. Any violation of this policy will result in sanctions, including a grade of zero for the specific challenge in question. It is imperative to adhere to the specified guidelines to maintain a fair and equitable assessment environment. Your cooperation is appreciated, and any concerns or questions should be directed to the exam proctor or instructor. Thank you for your understanding and compliance.\n",

The dataset used to train the model includes information about product prices, marketing costs, and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Product_Price`: The price of the product.\n",
    "- `Marketing_Cost`: The marketing cost associated with the product.\n",
    "- `Sales`: The number of product sales.\n",
    "- `Day_of_Week`: The day of the week when the sale occurred.\n",
    "- `Month`: The month when the sale occurred.\n",
    "- `Year`: The year when the sale occurred.\n",
    "- `Date`: The sale date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML regression pre-trained models:**\n",

    "**To Do Tasks:**\n",
    "Develop a StreamLit App where taking into consideration the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sidebar Structure:**\n",
    "   - Structure the sidebar with sections for the: home page, database exploration, and model testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Home Page:**\n",
    "   - The home page is a welcome page that provides a global overview of the app's purpose and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database Exploration:**\n",
    "   This section provides the following functianalities: \n",
    "   - Allow users to upload the product sales dataset in CSV format.\n",
    "   - Display a preview of the uploaded dataset.\n",
    "   - Provide a dataset description, summarizing key statistics and information about each column.\n",
    "   - Plot scatter plots between the input features (`Product_Price`, `Marketing_Cost`) and the output feature (`Sales`).\n",
    "   - Generate time series plots for `Product_Price`, `Marketing_Cost`, and `Sales` over time (`Date`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Testing:**\n",
    "   This sectio provides the following functinalities for testing a pre-trained model:\n",
    "   - Allow users to select a regression model to test (linear `resources/linear_model.pkl` or polynomial `resources/poly_model.pkl`).\n",
    "   - Provide UI elements for users to input test data (e.g., `Product_Price`, `Marketing_Cost`, `Day_of_Week`, `Month`, `Year`).\n",

    "**Evaluation Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UI Design:** Ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** Implement all the required features, including dataset upload, preview, relevant plots, and model testing.\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Provide comments and documentation for your code to enhance clarity.\n",
    "- **Organization:** Clearly organize your Streamlit app, separating sections logically.\n",
